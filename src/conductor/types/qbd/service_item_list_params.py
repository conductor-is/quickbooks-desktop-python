    Like `id`, `fullName` is a unique identifier for a service item, formed by by
    combining the names of its parent objects with its own `name`, separated by
    colons. For example, if a service item is under "Professional Services" and has
    the `name` "Consulting", its `fullName` would be "Professional
    Services:Consulting".

    Unlike `name`, `fullName` is guaranteed to be unique across all service item
    objects. Also, unlike `id`, `fullName` can be arbitrarily changed by the
    QuickBooks user when modifying its underlying `name` field.

    NOTE: If you include this parameter, QuickBooks will ignore all other query
    parameters.
